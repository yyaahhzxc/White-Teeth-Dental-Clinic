# White Teeth Dental Clinic - Desktop App Setup

## 🚀 Electron Desktop App Configuration Complete!

Your dental clinic app is now ready to be compiled into a Windows .exe desktop application.

## 📋 What's Been Set Up:

### 1. **Electron Main Process** (`electron.js`)
- Creates the main application window (1200x800)
- Handles backend server startup in production
- Manages window lifecycle and security
- Hides menu bar for cleaner UI
- Auto-starts your Node.js backend

### 2. **Build Configuration** (`package.json`)
- Updated app name to "White Teeth Dental Clinic"
- Added Electron scripts and build config
- Configured for Windows .exe generation
- Includes app icon and installer settings

### 3. **Development & Build Scripts**
- `npm run electron-dev` - Run in development (with hot reload)
- `npm run electron` - Run built version
- `npm run dist` - Create .exe installer
- `npm run build-desktop` - Complete build script

## 🔧 Available Commands:

### Development:
```bash
# Start React dev server + Electron window
npm run electron-dev

# Test Electron with built React app
npm run build-electron
```

### Production Build:
```bash
# Build complete desktop app (.exe)
npm run dist

# Or use the custom build script
npm run build-desktop
```

## 📦 Building Your .exe File:

1. **Build the complete app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build-desktop
   ```

2. **Find your .exe in the `dist` folder:**
   - `dist/White Teeth Dental Clinic Setup.exe` (installer)
   - `dist/win-unpacked/` (portable version)

## 🎯 App Features:
- ✅ Self-contained desktop application
- ✅ Bundled Node.js backend server
- ✅ SQLite database included
- ✅ Professional installer with desktop shortcut
- ✅ No need for browser or separate server
- ✅ Windows native look and feel

## 🔍 File Structure:
```
your-app/
├── electron.js           # Main Electron process
├── build-desktop.js      # Build helper script

```

## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Database Path**: The SQLite database will be bundled with the app
2. **Port Configuration**: Backend runs on localhost:3001 in production
3. **Security**: Electron security best practices implemented
4. **Cross-Platform**: Can build for Windows, macOS, and Linux
